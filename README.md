# my collection of exploits

### below is a list of all exploits and how they were used (list is still growing)


- [cve-2018-6389] exploit was used to do some hacktivism shit against antivaxxers & the austrian right-wing party "fpoe"
- [easydrivers] exploit was used to farm correct answers in the drivers license study program (which is terrible)
- [Dump] not really an exploit, used to dump & then deobfuscate the "esdeath client"
