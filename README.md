## im not responsible for any damage you're causing, if you abuse some script in here dont ever blame it on me
### below is a list of all exploits and how they were used

- the cve-2018-6089 exploit was used to do some hacktivism shit against antivaxxers & the austrian right-wing party "fpoe"
- the easydrivers exploit was used to farm correct answers in the drivers license study program (which is terrible)
